# image-resize
When the python image is resized, the interpolation method defines how the new pixels are computed. There are several interpolation techniques, each of which has its own quality vs. speed trade-offs.
Exp1a-Image Resizing: Scaling operations increase or reduce the size of an image. 
Exp1b-Image Rotation: Images can be rotated to any degree clockwise or otherwise. We just need to define rotation matrix listing rotation point, degree of rotation and the scaling factor. 
Exp1c-Image Translation: Translating an image means shifting it within a given frame of reference that can be along the x-axis and y-axis.
Exp1d-Image shearing: Image shearing is a geometric transformation that skews an image along one or both axes i.e x or y axis.
Exp1e-Image Normalization: Image normalization is a process of scaling the pixel values in an image to a specific range.This is often done to improve the performance of image processing algorithms, as many algorithms work better when the pixel values are within a certain range.
